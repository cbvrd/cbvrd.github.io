    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>Firstly in warmup The Cream Dream was buying awp and shooting and repetitively killing us from garage roof. A little annoying and rude but who cares. We get into the game. In pistol round I get an ace from a clean kill, so I get a little hyped and t-bag the dead guy I just headshot. My teammate types "get shit on" other team doesn't respond. We decide to save next round and get killed Cream Dream types "ez" and "yawn". I have enough money to buy an awp and get a quick ace next round and I type "get fucked" again no response. A few more rounds of banter and shit talking. Last round we were up one at 8 - 7 my teammate died early and other team shit talks to no end. I had a mag-7 and was on the roof. I drop down and kill the one guy that had an awp, then I lurk and wait for the last guy Cream Dream. I turn the corner and shoot him in the back and kill him whilst he had an ak. We win and I immediately type "get shit on" and my teammate spams insults Cream and peebean leave without even typing GG.<br><br>TLDR: These two got shit on after they were talking mad shit. I won the round with an ace with the mag-7. They left without even saying GG.</p></font>

    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>He was playing sniper on Upward and got killed a few times by me. While I was playing sniper. He then left saying his team was trash saying quote "Garbage cans would be better". I thought he was rude and bad so I went to his account and added him so I could get him mad. I called him bad and he got a little pissed but it wasn't enough. So I said that demon slayer is ass and that was the tipping point. He said "Kill yourself fagget" which was funny but not enough. He then said that he wasn't bad at the game because he gets hackusations called on him and he has over 1000 hours. This was actually bad for him because I (at the time of this event) only had 80 hours on sniper. So yeah if you are ass don't blame it on your team. He then blocked me.<br><br>TLDR: Guy was ass at the game and blamed it on his teammates. I killed him and called him bad. He then told me to kill myself and that he had 1000 hours on sniper which is 920 more hours then me as sniper. He then blocked me.<br>TLDR: Guy was ass at the game and blamed it on his teammates.

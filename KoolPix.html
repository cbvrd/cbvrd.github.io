    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>Firstly in warmup The Cream Dream was buying awp and shooting and repetitively killing us from garage roof. A little annoying and rude but who cares. We get into the game. In pistol round I get an ace from a clean kill, so I get a little hyped and t-bag the dead guy I just headshot. My teammate types "get shit on" other team doesn't respond. We decide to save next round and get killed Cream Dream types "ez" and "yawn". I have enough money to buy an awp and get a quick ace next round and I type "get fucked" again no response. A few more rounds of banter and shit talking. Last round we were up one at 8 - 7 my teammate died early and other team shit talks to no end. I had a mag-7 and was on the roof. I drop down and kill the one guy that had an awp, then I lurk and wait for the last guy Cream Dream. I turn the corner and shoot him in the back and kill him whilst he had an ak. We win and I immediately type "get shit on" and my teammate spams insults Cream and peebean leave without even typing GG.</p></font>

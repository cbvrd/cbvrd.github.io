    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>5/18/23 - 9:39 PM PST (CS:GO) Wingman, Lake<br>Users "The Cream Dream | ãƒ…" (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/slipshotpew">https://steamcommunity.com/id/slipshotpew</a>)<br>and "peenbean" (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198880718847/">https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198880718847/</a>)</p></font>
    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>Firstly in warmup The Cream Dream was buying awp and shooting and repetitively killing us from garage roof. A little annoying and rude but who cares. We get into the game. In pistol round I get an ace from a clean kill, so I get a little hyped and t-bag the dead guy I just headshot. My teammate types "get shit on" other team doesn't respond. We decide to save next round and get killed Cream Dream types "ez" and "yawn". I have enough money to buy an awp and get a quick ace next round and I type "get fucked" again no response. A few more rounds of banter and shit talking. Last round we were up one at 8 - 7 my teammate died early and other team shit talks to no end. I had a mag-7 and was on the roof. I drop down and kill the one guy that had an awp, then I lurk and wait for the last guy Cream Dream. I turn the corner and shoot him in the back and kill him whilst he had an ak. We win and I immediately type "get shit on" and my teammate spams insults Cream and peebean leave without even typing GG.<br><br>TLDR: These two got shit on after they were talking mad shit. I won the round with an ace with the mag-7. They left without even saying GG.</p></font>

    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>He was playing sniper on Upward and got killed a few times by me. While I was playing sniper. He then left saying his team was trash saying quote "Garbage cans would be better". I thought he was rude and bad so I went to his account and added him so I could get him mad. I called him bad and he got a little pissed but it wasn't enough. So I said that demon slayer is ass and that was the tipping point. He said "Kill yourself fagget" which was funny but not enough. He then said that he wasn't bad at the game because he gets hackusations called on him and he has over 1000 hours. This was actually bad for him because I (at the time of this event) only had 80 hours on sniper. So yeah if you are ass don't blame it on your team. He then blocked me.<br><br>TLDR: Guy was ass at the game and blamed it on his teammates. I killed him and called him bad. He then told me to kill myself and that he had 1000 hours on sniper which is 920 more hours then me as sniper. He then blocked me.<br><br>(Update) the guy had 7111.2 hours on sniper (I think he may have been using an infinite hours exploit) so anyway he must have been really bad to lose to me.</p></font>

    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>He was playing Pirate and I was playing Viking. (If you don't play Broken Edge thats fine they are just two different classes) I beat him one time and he accuses me of cheating. So next round he activated cheats. I then got beat. I took a video and have reported him to the creaters of the game and hopefully he gets banned. The game is a pretty small community so reporting actually works.<br>TLDR: Guy got mad at me beating the shit out of him. He then says I have cheats then he activeates his own. I have reported him and hopefully he gets banned.</p></font>

    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>10/21/23 - 11:15 AM PST (CS2) Competitive,<br>User "Speedcast" (<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104366919">https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198104366919</a>)</p></font>
    <font color="#d98ef0"><p><br>There were two rounds that I played with Speed, one was with him and one was against him. I was acting a little goofy and was talking when I was dead giving call outs. One of the call outs that I made was a joke saying that there was a dude behind him. He started telling me to stfu and stop talking. Of course, I didn't. He than said that he wouldn't listen to a bottem fragger. Now I was at the bottem of the leaderboard but I wasn't bottem fragging so I told him that he was actually bottem fragging not me, b/c he actually was bottem fragging. He then insaulted me thoughout the rest of the game. When the final score screen came up it showed that him and I had the same ADR. So I pointed it out and I also pointed out that I had more kills. He then got mad and just keep saying over and over again "you're bottem fragging" and I was laughing my ass off. The next game comes and him and I were on different teams. So it is a perfect time for me to get serrious and actually play the game. By the end of the game he had around 6 kills and I had around 17. I kept asking him why he was bottem fragging and bottem scoring, not only for his team but the entire server, and he would not give a responce.<br><br>TLDR: Shit player says I am bottem fragging even though I have more kills than him. Next game I beat him and he bottem frags for the entire server with, by the end of the game mind you, he only has 6 kills compared to my 17.</p></font>
